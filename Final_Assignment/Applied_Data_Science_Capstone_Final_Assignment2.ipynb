Murder, Theft, Robbery, etc), date when the crime has occured, and the office which has dealt with the crime.\n",

The data contains information such as the location where the rodent was sighted, proccess of the rodent inspection (Initial Inspection, Compliance inspection, Putting Bait, and Checking whether the place is clean or not). Following data will be used to see if there is a correlation between frequency of rodents detected and frequency of crime occuring.\n",
